# FinalProjectCSS

This folder includes two different CSS files that will show my off my CSS that I have learned over the course of this class. Each CSS file will be different, and will show off my CSS in different ways. The first CSS file is supposed to be a nice tie die themed site. The second is supposed to be a nice modern Newspaper/Article/Blog theme. Each have uses of box models, grids, fonts, and coloring, as well as use of margins, padding, and borders. The GitHub pages official link is https://starfox505.github.io/FinalProjectCSS/.
